# copyer
It copies many interesting files from a Windows PC to a tar archive, it also creates a snapshot of the file system and saves it to XML from the background, then you can view it in the "fsxml" tool.

This app has not been finished, therefore it may have errors, use it at your own risk, it has been made only for learning and educational purposes years ago :smile:

**Dependencies:**

- Python 2.7
- pywin32
- py2exe (to compile to exe file or you can chose any other like PyInstaller)
